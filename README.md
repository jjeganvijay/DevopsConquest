#Devops day1 of the conquest!
 Lets Conquer Everything with hardwork not for validation but for impact
## some commands for training on git hub
la -l used for listing everything in an specific folder
git clone url of the github repository
git 
today i have installed the jupter through the windows terminal and runned an file in the browesr by opening the link it was good 
Mlops short form mechine learning  operations refers to the principles of applying devops principles to mechine learning
Mlops Fundamentals
intro:
growth of data is increasing and importance of artificial intelligence has also increased over time data has increased but we need to make sure that we utilize the data in a right way and positive way right? thats where we have artificial intelligence ok fair enough we can just build a prediction model on top of it but we need to understand mechine learning is not just about building model why i say this because your ml code or whatever mechinary model is just 20% of your whole mechine learning or a whole business problem right thers's a lot of things which comes into that place and your mechine learning code is just 20% out of the whole set of things ML in the industry is more than training models Mechine Learning is 10% mechine learning and 90% engineering  
ML teams -What are the roles   
Dicover Raw Data ,Develop Features, Train Models
data Scientest->data Engineer->lawyer
Productionize Data Pipeline
Data Engineer
Deploy model
ML engineer
Integrate Service
Product ENgineer
Set Up Monitoring
Site Reliability Engineering
First POC -WHat Data Science sees
df=pd.read_csv('./data.csv')
lr.fit(df)
(...)
Nunpy-magic
(...)
classifier.fit(x_train, y_train)
realized before learning this mlops i need to learn python, pandas python data scince then menhine learning do a project then only i can come to the mlops to deploy and maintain it 
so back to learning the python this time i have linux installed in wsl in windows trminal and installed git in linux with ssh then an testkey to prove git hub have public and private key loacal mechine connected to the git hub account can push the codes into the github repo installed jupter that is used to run python visualize things very usefull ran a program python in jupter everytime we need jupetr we have to run an command  called jupetr jupyter notebook --no-browser --ip=127.0.0.1  this will give the link and we can open the jupter in the browser 
push my first python script into git hub repo
